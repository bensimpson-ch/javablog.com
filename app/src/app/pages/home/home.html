    <p>Post Body 3</p>

    <h2>API Demo</h2>
    <p>Response from <code>https://api.javablog.com/hello</code>:</p>
    <pre>{{ helloResponse() }}</pre>

    <h2>Commands Used</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>"we are going to setup a rest services application to eventually permit comments and feedback for blog posts.   As this service will need a database and other services, lets assume it will run in a docker image running inside a docker-compose constructed network.  this project will require a sonar and nexus connection - both are already in my maven settings.  Use spring boot and rest, jpa, security.
        version 4.0.2.  write a simple hello world "hello javablog"  and have the complete maven build test the hello world."</li>
      <li>"this isn't what I asked for.  I specifically asked for rest, jpa and security.  You gave me web mvc, jdbc drivers and a load of comments"</li>
      <li>"this is not what I asked for.  Have a look at the generated file I got by using the spring initialzr.  this is what i expected and asked for.  latest 4.0.2 parent starter, rest, jpa, security and NO MVC.  [Pasted text #2 +88 lines]"</li>
      <li>"we are going to try again - I've deleted your first draft.  I want a spring boot REST, JPA, Security application in a single jar, using maven and spring boot 4.0.2.  The application should import from spring boot starter parent 4.0.2. there should be a hello "javablog" rest service with a functional unit test using junit jupiter 5+ and a spring boot specific integration test.  put this project in the
        services directory. "</li>
      <li>"alright - my blogs backend needs to be dockerized - the angular app is delivered via github action to MS Azure.  The backend needs to be dockerized not just locally, but the container must be built via a github action that builds the image and makes it available to a server that will use the docker image. For now we will ignore the database and security complexity of hello world.  The backend will be
        served via a nginx proxy at api.javablog.com."</li>
      <li>"I have podman running locally"</li>
      <li>"Ok, I've reviewed the api-deploy.yml - its incomplete.  you do not know the server name where we will deploy the backend to yet.  why don't we store this as a variable with a public key so the action can communicate with the server - 161.97.175.172"</li>
      <li>"your instructions are not correct - copy and save as GHCR_TOKEN secret - where? "</li>
      <li>"aha, now you are giving accurate instructions."</li>
      <li>"I want the SERVER_HOST and SERVER_USER to also be variables since the script is visible to the world."</li>
      <li>"done, I added the correct non-root user and the host."</li>
      <li>"while I did everything you asked, the script fails to deploy. [error log from GitHub Actions showing ssh: no key found]"</li>
      <li>"there is no passphrase"</li>
      <li>"the problem was the spaces in the key. When I put the key in the api-deploy.yml incorrect spacing was added. the hello world is visible on my server now."</li>
      <li>"we are not done yet. I updated the dns and ssl settings and the hello javablog is available via https://api.javablog.com/hello using the 'full' ssl option and an nginx proxy with the certificates provided by Cloudflare. Lets hook the blog up to show hello - then response. For this we need to start a new post. As before, the post should be top most in the list. We are not concerned with anything other than following the previous patterns at this point. Create a post titled Post 3, with placeholder body Post Body 3, and the demo calling the hello world, then all of the prompts used to get to this point."</li>

    <p>I write this post on a train somewhere between Winterthur and the Airport. It's a quiet Sunday afternoon train
      without tourists or children - including my little angels. Working on the train has an advantage that it's generally
      a fixed block of time to get something done. It's literally a physical and mental "context switch" when you arrive
      at your destination. This switch is the pressure complete the task.  So, about that JavaBlog.com post, let's get started.</p>

    <p>I thought before I go too far developing this blog that it would be useful to develop an initial strategy for how
      I'd approach SEO with JavaBlog.com. I've done this in the past, using the early rules of meta tags and page titles.
      The rules have obviously changed, but the fundamentals haven't - content is king.</p>

    <p>For those unfamiliar: SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is how you make your content discoverable. One foundational
      step is creating a <strong>sitemap.xml</strong> - essentially a table of contents for search engines that lists
      every page on your site and when it was last updated. Without one, search engines have to guess what exists.</p>

    <p>I plan to promote my other endeavors using JavaBlog.com, including an application called Polybit.ch. But first,
      I need to master what I call "vibing" - using conversational prompts with AI coding assistants like Claude to
      build software iteratively. Think of it as pair programming where your partner has read every programming book
      ever written but needs you to drive the vision.</p>

    <p>This blog has value to me on both a personal and financial level. I purchased this domain in 2002 - I love
      coffee and coding so I thought it was a perfect match. I was 29, fresh from studying foreign languages and math.
      A fantastic Russian professor had encouraged me to find something to talk about with people who speak my languages.
      Fast forward 24 years and roughly $500 in domain renewals - I'm ready, again, for the sixth time.</p>

    <h2>What I Did Today</h2>

    <p>I used Claude to generate a sitemap.xml based on my existing page structure. More importantly, I configured the
      project rules (in a <code>claude.md</code> file) so that future pages are automatically added to the sitemap
      when created. This "set it and forget it" automation is where AI-assisted coding really pays off.</p>

    <p>At the end of this session, I submitted my sitemap.xml to the
      <a href="https://search.google.com/search-console">Google Search Console</a> and will wait a few days until
      this content is indexed. It's the long game with SEO - content and "safe" best practices. Cheers.</p>

    <h2>Commands Used</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>"the next few prompts will be public, including this one. I want to improve the SEO of my blog so that others can find my posts and be inspired to also experiment with 'vibing' or 'LLM assisted coding'. The task today is to improve the SEO for the website https://javablog.com. The website has a single path that is currently visible - '/'. Create a sitemap.xml that I can submit to the google search console. Also suggest an approach to SEO that: 1. works with translated content. 2. works in a single PR. 3. Can be extended later when there is more content."</li>
      <li>"lets define a favicon.ico file that shows a capital 'J' in a darker purple with a background color white."</li>
      <li>"I have convert installed, you can run that command."</li>
      <li>"Alright - start a blog post in the home component above the previous post. chronologically, the newest post will be at the top. Title: Setting Up SEO with Claude, first steps. In the body do not write anything just write 'body here'. After the body, leave an area for 'commands used'."</li>
      <li>"I would like you to include my rule about adding new pages to sitemap.xml to my claude.md. In the future, when I make changes to the site structure, automatically update my sitemap.xml file."</li>
      <li>"Great. Update my commands to include the history of this 'vibe' session. Good job. Commit it in our names. I will review the commits for any unexpected changes."</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Coding with Claude has become so fun and interesting that I've decided to share these adventures
      on my javablog.com. I've been "vibe" coding on a weekly basis for the past 6-months on personal projects. At
      work I use github co-pilot selectively to generate tests, translate from English to German or for technical
      documentation like Plant UML: sequence and class diagrams. I've tried Gemini's CLI - it did well but
      Claude is better so far.
    </p>
    <p>
      I generally avoid letting claude run my maven build, npm or ng tools. I've seen that my token allocation would dry
      up without much to show for it. I set the clear boundary that Claude codes, I test and build. By coding, the
      coding
      agent is not writing without me specifying what I want. The specification is generally a series of short questions
      about trade-offs, best practices and then I have a minimal specification for the next step.</p>
    <p>So, in this project I've gone out of my comfort zone and let the coding agent just build it with a minimum amount
      of inputs. I will share my prompts at the end - and the github repository should be publicly visible:
      <a href="https://github.com/bensimpson-ch/javablog.com">Github - Javablog.com</a></p>
    <h2>The Stack</h2>
    <p>
      JavaBlog.com runs on the following stack:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Angular 20</strong> with static site generation (SSG)</li>
      <li><strong>Azure Static Web Apps</strong> for hosting</li>
      <li><strong>Cloudflare</strong> for DNS and CDN</li>
      <li><strong>GitHub Actions</strong> for CI/CD</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>My Prompts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>"you now should have access to javablog.com... I want to use it to make posts. I think given your talents - we will not use a blogging tool, instead we will just create content. create a claude.md for you to follow"</li>
      <li>"You took it too far. I want an angular application app to live in an app directory. when the github action triggers, it should build the app and deploy it to azure."</li>
      <li>"I want it built from day one to be SEO and AI friendly."</li>
      <li>"use the latest version of angular - its already installed."</li>
      <li>"create a standard gitignore for an angular and claude project. i've already created the file in javablog.com"</li>
      <li>"we need to setup a protocol for you preparing a post for me. It will use my name so I have the final say on content, etc. The first post will be about the blog itself, its structure and our collaboration. first things first, the layout. I want a simple layout. JavaBlog.com is the title of the blog top right. There will only be blog entries which will be listed on the index.html."</li>
      <li>"create a post to show how the first post will look. make it about setting up this blog together with you."</li>
      <li>"This isn't what I specified. Do not abbreviate the first post. It should live at javablog.com/ as well as its seo path."</li>
      <li>"Stick to just the prompts used to build the blogging website. list the prompts in the ul element of home.html including this one."</li>
    </ul>
