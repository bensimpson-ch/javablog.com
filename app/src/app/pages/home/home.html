    <p>I write this post on a train somewhere between Winterthur and the Airport. It's a quiet Sunday afternoon train
      without tourists or children - including my little angels. Working on the train has an advantage that it's generally
      a fixed block of time to get something done. It's literally a physical and mental "context switch" when you arrive
      at your destination. This switch is the pressure complete the task.  So, about that JavaBlog.com post, let's get started.</p>

    <p>I thought before I go too far developing this blog that it would be useful to develop an initial strategy for how
      I'd approach SEO with JavaBlog.com. I've done this in the past, using the early rules of meta tags and page titles.
      The rules have obviously changed, but the fundamentals haven't - content is king.</p>

    <p>For those unfamiliar: SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is how you make your content discoverable. One foundational
      step is creating a <strong>sitemap.xml</strong> - essentially a table of contents for search engines that lists
      every page on your site and when it was last updated. Without one, search engines have to guess what exists.</p>

    <p>I plan to promote my other endeavors using JavaBlog.com, including an application called Polybit.ch. But first,
      I need to master what I call "vibing" - using conversational prompts with AI coding assistants like Claude to
      build software iteratively. Think of it as pair programming where your partner has read every programming book
      ever written but needs you to drive the vision.</p>

    <p>This blog has value to me on both a personal and financial level. I purchased this domain in 2002 - I love
      coffee and coding so I thought it was a perfect match. I was 29, fresh from studying foreign languages and math.
      A fantastic Russian professor had encouraged me to find something to talk about with people who speak my languages.
      Fast forward 24 years and roughly $500 in domain renewals - I'm ready, again, for the sixth time.</p>

    <h2>What I Did Today</h2>

    <p>I used Claude to generate a sitemap.xml based on my existing page structure. More importantly, I configured the
      project rules (in a <code>claude.md</code> file) so that future pages are automatically added to the sitemap
      when created. This "set it and forget it" automation is where AI-assisted coding really pays off.</p>

    <p>At the end of this session, I submitted my sitemap.xml to the
      <a href="https://search.google.com/search-console">Google Search Console</a> and will wait a few days until
      this content is indexed. It's the long game with SEO - content and "safe" best practices. Cheers.</p>

    <h2>Commands Used</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>"the next few prompts will be public, including this one. I want to improve the SEO of my blog so that others can find my posts and be inspired to also experiment with 'vibing' or 'LLM assisted coding'. The task today is to improve the SEO for the website https://javablog.com. The website has a single path that is currently visible - '/'. Create a sitemap.xml that I can submit to the google search console. Also suggest an approach to SEO that: 1. works with translated content. 2. works in a single PR. 3. Can be extended later when there is more content."</li>
      <li>"lets define a favicon.ico file that shows a capital 'J' in a darker purple with a background color white."</li>
      <li>"I have convert installed, you can run that command."</li>
      <li>"Alright - start a blog post in the home component above the previous post. chronologically, the newest post will be at the top. Title: Setting Up SEO with Claude, first steps. In the body do not write anything just write 'body here'. After the body, leave an area for 'commands used'."</li>
      <li>"I would like you to include my rule about adding new pages to sitemap.xml to my claude.md. In the future, when I make changes to the site structure, automatically update my sitemap.xml file."</li>
      <li>"Great. Update my commands to include the history of this 'vibe' session. Good job. Commit it in our names. I will review the commits for any unexpected changes."</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Coding with Claude has become so fun and interesting that I've decided to share these adventures
      on my javablog.com. I've been "vibe" coding on a weekly basis for the past 6-months on personal projects. At
      work I use github co-pilot selectively to generate tests, translate from English to German or for technical
      documentation like Plant UML: sequence and class diagrams. I've tried Gemini's CLI - it did well but
      Claude is better so far.
    </p>
    <p>
      I generally avoid letting claude run my maven build, npm or ng tools. I've seen that my token allocation would dry
      up without much to show for it. I set the clear boundary that Claude codes, I test and build. By coding, the
      coding
      agent is not writing without me specifying what I want. The specification is generally a series of short questions
      about trade-offs, best practices and then I have a minimal specification for the next step.</p>
    <p>So, in this project I've gone out of my comfort zone and let the coding agent just build it with a minimum amount
      of inputs. I will share my prompts at the end - and the github repository should be publicly visible:
      <a href="https://github.com/bensimpson-ch/javablog.com">Github - Javablog.com</a></p>
    <h2>The Stack</h2>
    <p>
      JavaBlog.com runs on the following stack:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Angular 20</strong> with static site generation (SSG)</li>
      <li><strong>Azure Static Web Apps</strong> for hosting</li>
      <li><strong>Cloudflare</strong> for DNS and CDN</li>
      <li><strong>GitHub Actions</strong> for CI/CD</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>My Prompts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>"you now should have access to javablog.com... I want to use it to make posts. I think given your talents - we will not use a blogging tool, instead we will just create content. create a claude.md for you to follow"</li>
      <li>"You took it too far. I want an angular application app to live in an app directory. when the github action triggers, it should build the app and deploy it to azure."</li>
      <li>"I want it built from day one to be SEO and AI friendly."</li>
      <li>"use the latest version of angular - its already installed."</li>
      <li>"create a standard gitignore for an angular and claude project. i've already created the file in javablog.com"</li>
      <li>"we need to setup a protocol for you preparing a post for me. It will use my name so I have the final say on content, etc. The first post will be about the blog itself, its structure and our collaboration. first things first, the layout. I want a simple layout. JavaBlog.com is the title of the blog top right. There will only be blog entries which will be listed on the index.html."</li>
      <li>"create a post to show how the first post will look. make it about setting up this blog together with you."</li>
      <li>"This isn't what I specified. Do not abbreviate the first post. It should live at javablog.com/ as well as its seo path."</li>
      <li>"Stick to just the prompts used to build the blogging website. list the prompts in the ul element of home.html including this one."</li>
    </ul>
